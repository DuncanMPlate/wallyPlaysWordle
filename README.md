# wallyPlaysWordle
building an AI to play Wordle
Primary goal is to build a NN that can successfully play the popular word game Wordle. Ideal success would be 3/6. The AI cannot presently play Wordle like a human would, but I will be building an independent library of words for it to pull from. 
set up a website to host the wordle app

TO DO LIST:
	
	generate userauth so people can have accounts
	generate scoring parameters for individual accounts 
	generate a bot to play wordle on the webpage
	generate NN to learn from bots behavior and improve bots scores
	address bug#1: not providing information for double letters in the wordle
